## Project Layout
Project follows standard Nuxt webpack project layout with a few defaults.

### index.js
This is the entry point when this project is included as a module by ui chasis. All the required exports of this module should be in index.js. Since the parent chasis ui assumes the exported project has certain structure and properties, structure of exported entity should not be changed.

### src
- **main.js & App.vue** : Those files serve as entry points when the project is developed or tested as a standalone ui. Those files provide a basic ui chasis similar to the actual ui chasis. 
- **components** : Project specific ui components or mixins should be here and exported by index.js
- **pages** : Actual web pages provided by this project should be here and exported by index.js
- **router** : Static rotue definitions of this project should be defined in index.js as a route list
- **store** : Custom vuex store modules should be defined and exported in index.js

### mockserver
mock implementations of some common backed services to ease local testing or development.
`index.js` & `setup.js` files configure and run a regular express server; **handlers** directory contains actual mock endpoints.
by default it uses port 2000
